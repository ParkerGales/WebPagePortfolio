      <h2 class="border-top">About Parker</h2>
        <p>After going to college in Oegon in 2010 i decided to buy a  cheap 1985 Ford van and pursue my dream of rock climbing full time, along the way i bought a wolf dog to join me in the wildeness and  pushed that old van over 100,000 miles across the most beautiful places in north america. The rest is history!</p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I hope to take away the skills to contribute to an already amazing community of brilliant minds!</p>

        <p>As my skills progress I'm starting to understand the vast need for developers, if you're looking for someone who's driven and creative, I'm your guy. I'm extremely excited about this new chapter of learning and creating, so feel free to reach out!</p>
